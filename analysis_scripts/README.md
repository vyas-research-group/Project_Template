# Analysis

This is a good place to store top-level scripts that run on 'raw' data to either produce formatted csvs for plotting, or to make the plots themselves.

Don't forget to include any system requirements needed to reproduce the analysis here. While each file should be commented, it can be useful to use a bulleted list to briefly describe what each file is for.

If you made a cool figure with blender, chimeraX or some other software, please describe some of that process somewhere in this folder.
